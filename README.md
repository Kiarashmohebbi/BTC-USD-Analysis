# BTC-USD-Analysis
BTC-USD
This project simulates a simple Bitcoin (BTC) trading strategy.
Using simulated historical data, the code buys BTC every Wednesday at the Open price and sells it on Friday at the Close price.
The initial capital is set at $1,000.

The script processes the data using the pandas and matplotlib libraries, tracking the portfolio value (cash + BTC holdings) over time.
At the end, it generates a plot showing the portfolio's performance.

This project is useful for understanding periodic trading strategies and analyzing their outcomes.
